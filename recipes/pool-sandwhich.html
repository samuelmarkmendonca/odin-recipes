    <p> Pool days take a whole day sometimes. Kids often get really hungry during lunchtime and theres a 
        big dillema, give them half hearted peanut butter sandwiches which arent filling or a full blown lunch
        which will give them a hard time in the pool? Well we have a solution. Our pool sandwiches give you the best 
        of both worlds, and are very easy to make. Say goodbye to those bad pool days of yours!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 round bread loaf</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>1/2 sliced deli ham</li>
        <li>1/2 pound sliced deli turkey </li>
        <li>6 slices swiss cheese</li>
        <li>6 slices Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you're making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top.  </li>
        <li>Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break through the sides. The loaf interior can be used to make croutons, so there's no waste.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in a small bowl. Mix well. </li>
        <li>Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf and top; place loaf and top on a baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool.  </li>
        <li>Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the hollowed-out loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of ham and turkey. Repeat until the loaf is full. Top with reserved bread top. </li>
        <li>Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top with something to weigh it down. </li>
        <li>Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight. </li>
        <li>Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular sections. </li>
